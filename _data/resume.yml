  summary: Academic Careers Understood through Measurement and Norms (ACUMEN) was
    an FP7 European research collaboration (2011-2014) aimed at understanding the
    ways in which researchers are evaluated by their peers and by institutions, and
    at assessing how the science system can be improved and enhanced. As this was
    a collaboration between seven institutions in which CWTS-Leiden University took
    the lead, project team meetings, proceedings, deliverables, schedules, and budgets
    needed coordination, which were my task in the final eight months of the project.

    Flanders, and Surinam:  the Benelux Debate Competition. The Foundation is led
